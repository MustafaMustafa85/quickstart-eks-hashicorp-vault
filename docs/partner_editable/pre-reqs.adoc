==== Prepare for the deployment

The {partner-company-name} {partner-product-short-name} UI service's load balancer requires a valid AWS Certificate Manager(ACM) certificate.

Option 1: Let the Quick Start create one

* Provide both a Route 53 Hosted Zone id and domain name for the {partner-product-short-name} load balancer.

Option 2: Bring your own

* Provide your own ACM certificate.

NOTE: The ACM certificate must reside in the same AWS Region in which you are deploying this Quick Start
